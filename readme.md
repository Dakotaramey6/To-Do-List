## How to install-
Install all three folders to make this run properly(script.js, style.css and index.html). If you don't have all three files the App will not run as intended. 

### How to use-
Once installed you just need to run the index.html by double clicking the icon (named index.html )or using git Bash cd into the location you placed the folder and type the following command into the CLI ./index.html.
